    Design patterns represent the best practices used by experienced object-oriented software developers.
    Design patterns are solutions to general problems that software developers faced during software development.
    These solutions were obtained by trial and error by numerous software developers over quite a substantial period of time.

        What is Gang of Four (GOF)?
    In 1994, four authors Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson and John Vlissides published a book
    titled Design Patterns - Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software which initiated the concept of Design Pattern
    in Software development.

        Common platform for developers
    Design patterns provide a standard terminology and are specific to particular scenario.
    For example, a singleton design pattern signifies use of single object so all developers familiar with single design
    pattern will make use of single object and they can tell each other that program is following a singleton pattern.

Types of Design Patterns:
    1. Creational Patterns
    2. Structural Patterns
    3. Behavioral Patterns
