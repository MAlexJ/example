Strategy Pattern
A Strategy Pattern says that "defines a family of functionality, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable".

The Strategy Pattern is also known as Policy.

Benefits:
* It provides a substitute to subclassing.
* It defines each behavior within its own class, eliminating the need for conditional statements.
* It makes it easier to extend and incorporate new behavior without changing the application.

Usage:
* When the multiple classes differ only in their behaviors.e.g. Servlet API.
* It is used when you need different variations of an algorithm.
