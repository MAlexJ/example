### Control Statement

Control statements decide the flow
(order or sequence of execution of statements) of a Java program.
In Java, statements are parsed from top to bottom.
Therefore, using the control flow statements can interrupt a particular section of a
program based on a certain condition.

1. Conditional or Selection Statements

- if Statement
- if-else statement
- if-else-if statement
- switch statement

2. Loop or Iterative Statements

- for Loop
- while Loop
- do-while Loop
- for-each Loop

3. Flow Control or Jump Statements

- return
- continue
- break
