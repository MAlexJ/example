### Decoupling in Java

Decoupling in programming means reducing the interdependence between the different components or modules of software
system.
It is all about creating components that are independent and can be used elsewhere with minimal changes,
and that can be tested and maintained independently.

By reducing interdependence, decoupling allows developers to create software systems that are more resilient, scalable,
and easier to maintain.

In practice this means that components can be updated, replaced, or removed without impacting other parts of the system,
making the overall system easier to maintain.
