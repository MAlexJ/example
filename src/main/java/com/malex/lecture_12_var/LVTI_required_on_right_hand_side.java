/*
 * Q6. Why is an initializer required on the right-hand side of var?
 *
 * link: https://openjdk.org/projects/amber/guides/lvti-faq
 *
 * The type of the variable is inferred from the type of the initializer.
 * This means, of course, that var can only be used when there is an initializer.
 * We could have chosen to infer the type from the assignments to the variable,
 * but that would have made the feature considerably more complex, and it could potentially lead to misleading
 * or hard-to-diagnose errors.
 * In order to keep things simple, weâ€™ve defined var so that only local information is used for type inference.
 *
 * To avoid these problems, it seems preferable to require that the type be inferred using an explicit initializer.
