 * A SortedMap extended with navigation methods returning the closest matches for given search targets.
 * Methods lowerEntry, floorEntry, ceilingEntry, and higherEntry return Map.
 *
 * Entry objects associated with keys respectively less than, less than or equal, greater than or equal,
 * and greater than a given key, returning null if there is no such key.
 *
 * Similarly, methods lowerKey, floorKey, ceilingKey, and higherKey return only the associated keys.
 * All of these methods are designed for locating, not traversing entries.
