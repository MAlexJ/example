#### The following quick reference summarizes the operators supported by the Java programming language.

#### Simple Assignment Operator

```
=       Simple assignment operator
```

#### Arithmetic Operators

```
+       Additive operator (also used for String concatenation)
-       Subtraction operator
*       Multiplication operator
/       Division operator
%       Remainder operator
```

#### Unary Operators

```
+       Unary plus operator; indicates
        positive value (numbers are 
        positive without this, however)
-       Unary minus operator; negates
        an expression
++      Increment operator; increments a value by 1
--      Decrement operator; decrements a value by 1
!       Logical complement operator; inverts the value of a boolean
```

#### Equality and Relational Operators

```
==      Equal to
!=      Not equal to
>       Greater than
>=      Greater than or equal to
<       Less than
<=      Less than or equal to
```

#### Conditional Operators

```
&&      Conditional-AND
||      Conditional-OR
?:      Ternary (shorthand for if-then-else statement)
```

#### Type Comparison Operator

```
instanceof      Compares an object to a specified type
```

#### Bitwise and Bit Shift Operators

```
~       Unary bitwise complement
<<      Signed left shift
>>      Signed right shift
>>>     Unsigned right shift
&       Bitwise AND
^       Bitwise exclusive OR
|       Bitwise inclusive OR
```
