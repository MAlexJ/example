 * In generic code, the question mark (?), called the wildcard, represents an unknown type. The

 * variable; - sometimes as a return type (though it is better programming practice to be more
 * specific).
 *
 * <p>The wildcard is never used as a type argument for a generic method invocation, a generic class
 * instance creation, or a supertype.

     * functionality provided in the Object class. - When the code is using methods in the generic
     * class that don't depend on the type parameter. For example, List.size or List.clear. - In fact,
     * Class<?> is so often used because most of the methods in Class<T> do not depend on T.
