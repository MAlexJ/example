<br>
<br>
AES is a symmetric block encryption algorithm (block size 128 bits, key  128/192/256 bits)
<br>
The algorithm described by AES is a symmetric-key algorithm, meaning the same key is used for both encrypting 
and decrypting the data.

<br>
The AES algorithm is an iterative, symmetric-key block cipher that supports 
cryptographic keys (secret keys) of 128, 192, and 256 bits 
to encrypt and decrypt data in blocks of 128 bits. <br>
